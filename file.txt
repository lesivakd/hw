The history of Russia begins with the histories of the East Slavs.The traditional startdate of specifically Russian history is the establishment of the Rus state in the north in 862 ruled by Vikings. Staraya Ladoga and Novgorod became the first major cities of the new union of immigrants from Scandinavia with the Slavs and FinnoUgrians. In 882 Prince Oleg of Novgorod seized Kiev, thereby uniting the northern and southern lands of the Eastern Slavs under one authority. The state adopted Christianity from the Byzantine Empire in 988, beginning the synthesis of Byzantine and Slavic cultures that defined Orthodox Slavic culture for the next millennium. Kievan Rus ultimately disintegrated as a state due to the Mongol invasions in 1237–1240 along with the resulting deaths of significant number of population.April begins on the same day of the week as July and January in leap years only.

Vladimir Spiridonovichs father was a cook to Vladimir Lenin. Putins birth was preceded by the deaths of two brothers, Viktor and Albert, born in the mid1930s. Albert died in infancy and Viktor died of diphtheria during the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germanys forces in World War II.[24] Putins mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the Soviet Navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. Early in World War II, his father served in the destruction battalion of the NKVD. Later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. Putins maternal grandmother was killed by the German occupiers of Tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared on the Eastern Front during World War II.Born to a moderately prosperous middleclass family in Simbirsk, now Ulyanovsk, Russia, Lenin embraced revolutionary socialist politics following his brothers 1887 execution. Expelled from Kazan Imperial University for participating in protests against the Russian Empires Tsarist autocracy, he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to Saint Petersburg in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for sedition and exiled to Shushenskoye for three years, where he married Nadezhda Krupskaya. After his exile,Lenine moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In 1903, he took a key role in the RSDLP ideological split, leading the Bolshevik faction against Julius Martovs Mensheviks. Following Russias failed Revolution of 1905, he campaigned for the First World War to be transformed into a Europewide proletarian revolution, which he believed as a Marxist would cause the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement with socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution ousted Tsar Nicholas II and established the Russian Provisional Government, he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.Art is a diverse range of human activities involving the creation of visual, auditory or performing artifacts artworks, which express the creators imagination, conceptual ideas, or technical skill, intended to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.

He studied Oriental languages and law at the University of Kazan but left before completing a degree. In 1851 he joined an artillery regiment in the Caucasus. He took part in the Crimean War and after the defense of Sevastopol wrote The Sevastopol Sketches 1955, which established his literary reputation. After leaving the army in 1856, Tolstoy spent time in St. Petersburg and abroad before settling at Yasnaya Polyana, where he involved himself in the running of peasant schools and the emancipation of the serfs. In 1862 he married Sofya Andreevna Behrs they had thirteen children. Tolstoy wrote two great novels, War and Peace 1869 and Anna Karenina 1877, as well as many short stories and essays. He died in 1910.In 1951, after reading War and Peace for the twelfth time, the Russian writer Mikhail Prishvin 18731954 noted in his diary that he felt, at last, that he understood his life. Like all great works of art, Tolstoys masterpiece has the capacity, on each successive reading, to transform our understanding of the world.On any first reading, War and Peace is bound to dazzle with its immense panorama of humanity. The whole of life appears to be contained in its pages. Tolstoy presents us with a cast of several hundred characters. Yet to each one he brings such profound understanding of the human condition, with all its frailties and contradictions, that we recognize and love these characters as reflections of our own identity. Tolstoy has an extraordinary clarity of expression  a quality which Anthony Briggs has happily maintained in this superb translation. Tolstoy might write longer novels than anybody else, but no other writer can recreate emotion and experience with such precision and economy. There are scenes in War and Peace  the unforgettable depiction of the Battle of Austerlitz, for example, or the ball where Natasha Rostov meets Prince Andrey  in which Tolstoy manages in a few words to sketch the mental images which allow us to picture ourselves at the scene and seemingly to feel the emotions of the protagonists. There are passages, like the deathscene of Prince Andrey, in which Tolstoy may give to his readers the extraordinary sensation that they too have felt the experience of death and moments, like the wonderful description of the hunt, when Tolstoy lets them imagine what it is like to be a dog. Tolstoy once said famously that War and Peace was not meant to be a novel at all. Like all great works of art, it certainly defies all conventions. Set against the historical events of the Napoleonic Wars, its complex narrative development is a long way from the tidy plot structure of the European novel in its nineteenthcentury form. Tolstoys novel does not even have a clear beginning, middle and end, though it does, in one sense, turn on a moment of epiphany, the year of 1812, when Russias liberation from Napoleon is made to coincide with the personal liberation of the novels central characters. While clearly still a novel, War and Peace can be understood, at another level, as a novelists attempt to engage with the truth of history. Tolstoys interest in history developed long before his career as a novelist. But historywriting disappointed him. It seemed to reduce the richness of real life. For whereas the real history of lived experience was made up of an infinite number of factors and contingencies, historians selected just a few for example, the political or the economic to develop their theories and explanations. Tolstoy concluded that the histories of his day represented perhaps only 0.001 per cent of the elements which actually constitute the real history of peoples. 1 He was particularly frustrated by the failure of historians to illuminate the inner life of a society  the private thoughts and relationships that make up the most real and immediate experience of human beings. Hence he turned to literature. Through the novels central characters Tolstoy juxtaposes the immediate human experience of historical events with the historical memory of them. For example, when Pierre Bezukhov wanders as a spectator on to the battlefield of Borodino he expects to find the sort of neatly arranged battle scene that he has seen in paintings and read about in history books. Instead, he finds himself in the chaos of an actual battlefield  Everything Pierre saw on either hand looked so indistinct that, glancing left or right over the landscape, he could find nothing that quite lived up to his expectations. Nowhere was there a field of battle as such, the kind of thing he had expected there was nothing but ordinary fields, clearings, troops, woods, smoking campfires, villages, mounds and little streams. Here was a living landscape, and try as he might he could not make out any military positioning. He could not even tell our troops from theirs. Vol. III, Book II, ch. 21 Having served as an officer in the Crimean War 18546, Tolstoy drew from his own experience to recreate the human truth of this celebrated battle, and to examine how its public memory could become distorted by the medium of written history. As Tolstoy shows, in the confusion of the battle nobody can understand or control what occurs. In such a situation, chance events, individual acts of bravery or calm thinking by the officers can influence the morale of the troops en masse and thus change the course of the battle and this in turn creates the illusion that what is happening is somehow the result of human agency. So when the military dispatches are later written up, they invariably ascribe the outcome of the battle to the commanders, although in reality they had less influence than the random actions of the rank and file. By using these dispatches, historians are able to impose a rational pattern and historical meaning on the battle, although neither was apparent at the time of fighting. As a novelist, Tolstoy was interested most of all in the inner life of Russian society during the Napeolonic Wars. In War and Peace he presents this period of history as a crucial watershed in the culture of the Russian aristocracy. The war of 1812 is portrayed as a national liberation from the cultural domination of the French  a moment when Russian noblemen like the Rostovs and Bolkonskys struggled to break free from the foreign conventions of their society and began new lives on Russian principles. Tolstoy plots this transformation in a series of motifs. In Tolstoys text the novel opens, for example, in the French language of the Petersburg salon  a language that Tolstoy gradually reveals to be false and artificial the novels most idealized characters, such as Princess Marya and the peasant Karatayev, speak exclusively in Russian, or, like Natasha, speak French only with mistakes. Tolstoy shows the aristocracy renouncing haute cuisine for Spartan lunches of rye bread and cabbage soup, adopting national dress, settling as farmers on the land and rediscovering their countrys native culture, as in the immortal scene when Natasha, a Frencheducated young countess, dances to a folk song in the Russian style. On this reading, War and Peace appears as a national epic  the revelation of a Russian consciousness in the inner life of its characters. In narrating this drama, however, Tolstoy steps out of historical time and enters the timespace of cultural myth. He allows himself considerable artistic licence. For example, the aristocracys return to native forms of dress and recreations actually took place over several decades in the early nineteenth century, whereas Tolstoy has it happen almost overnight in 1812. But the literary creation of this mythical timespace was central to the role which War and Peace was set to play in the formation of the national consciousness. When the first part of the novel appeared, in 18656, educated Russia was engaged in a profound cultural and political quest to define the countrys national identity. The emancipation of the serfs, in 1861, had forced society to confront the humble peasant as a fellowcitizen and to seek new answers to the old accursed questions about Russias destiny in what one poet Nikolay Nekrasov called the rural depths where eternal silence reigns.2 The liberal reforms of Tsar Alexander II Emperor of Russia 185581, which included the introduction of jury trials and elected institutions of local government, gave rise to hopes that Russia, as a nation, would emerge and join the family of modern European states. Writing from this perspective, Tolstoy saw a parallel between the Russia of the 1860s and the Russia that had arisen in the wars against Napoleon. War and Peace was originally conceived and drafted as a novel about the Decembrists, a group of liberal army officers who rose up in a failed attempt to impose a constitution on the Tsar in December 1825. In this original version of the novel the Decembrist hero returns after thirty years of exile in Siberia to the intellectual ferment of the early years of Alexander IIs reign. But the more Tolstoy researched into the Decembrists, the more he realized that their intellectual roots were to be found in the war of 1812. This was when these officers had first become acquainted with the patriotic virtues of the peasant soldiers in their ranks when they had come to realize the potential of Russias democratic nationhood. Through this literary genesis, War and Peace acquired several overlapping spheres of historical consciousness the realtime of 180520 the fictional setting of the novel the living memory of this period from which Tolstoy drew in the form of personal memoirs and historical accounts and its reflection in the political consciousness of 185565. Thus the novel can and should be read, not just as an intimate portrait of Russian society in the age of the Napoleonic Wars, but as a broader statement about Russia, its people and its history as a whole. That is why the Russians will always turn to War and Peace, as Mikhail Prishvin did, to find in it the keys to their identity. English readers will learn more about the Russians by reading War and Peace than they will by reading perhaps any other book. But they will also find in it the inspiration to make them think about the world and their own place in it. For War and Peace is a universal work and, like all the great artistic prose works of the Russian tradition, it functions as a huge poetic structure for the contemplation of the fundamental questions of our existence. Well, Prince, Genoa and Lucca are now nothing more than estates taken over by the Buonaparte family.1 No, I give you fair warning. If you wont say this means war, if you will allow yourself to condone all the ghastly atrocities perpetrated by that Antichrist  yes, thats what I think he is  I shall disown you. Youre no friend of mine  not the "faithful slave" you claim to be . . . But how are you How are you keeping I can see Im intimidating you. Do sit down and talk to me.These words were spoken in French one evening in July 1805 by the wellknown Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honour and confidante of the Empress Maria Fyodorovna, as she welcomed the first person to arrive at her soiree, Prince Vasily Kuragin, a man of high rank and influence. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for the last few days and she called it la grippe  grippe being a new word not yet in common currency. A footman of hers in scarlet livery had gone around that morning delivering notes written in French, each saying precisely the same thing If you have nothing better to do, Count or Prince, and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor sick lady is not too unnerving, I shall be delighted to see you at my residence between seven and ten. ANNETTE SCHERERMy goodness, what a violent attack replied the prince, who had only just come in and was not in the least put out by this welcome. Dressed in his embroidered court uniform with kneebreeches, shoes and stars across his chest, he looked at her with a flat face of undisturbed serenity. His French was the elegant tongue of our grandparents, who used it for thought as well as speech, and it carried the soft tones of condescension that come naturally to an eminent personage grown old in high society and at court. He came up to Anna Pavlovna and kissed her hand, presenting to her a perfumed and glistening bald pate, and then seated himself calmly on the sofa. First things first, he said. How are you, my dear friend Put my mind at rest. His voice remained steady, and his tone, for all its courtesy and sympathy, implied indifference and even gentle mockery. How can one feel well when one is . . . suffering in a moral sense Can any sensitive person find peace of mind nowadays said Anna Pavlovna. I do hope youre staying all evening.Well, there is that reception at the English Ambassadors. Its Wednesday. I must show my face, said the prince. My daughter is coming to take me there. I thought tonights festivities had been cancelled. I must say all these celebrations and fireworks are becoming rather tedious. If they had known you wanted the celebration cancelled, it would have been, said the prince with the predictability of a woundup clock. Sheer habit made him say things he didnt even mean. Stop teasing me. Come on, tell me whats been decided about Novosiltsevs dispatch2 You know everything. What is there to tell replied the prince in a cold, bored tone. Whats been decided Theyve decided that Bonaparte has burnt his boats, and I rather think were getting ready to burn ours. Prince Vasily always spoke languidly, like an actor declaiming a part from an old play. Anna Pavlovna Scherer was just the opposite  all verve and excitement, despite her forty years. To be an enthusiast had become her special role in society, and she would sometimes wax enthusiastic when she didnt feel like it, so as not to frustrate the expectations of those who knew her. The discreet smile that never left her face, though it clashed with her faded looks, gave her the appearance of a spoilt child with a charming defect that she was well aware of, though she neither wished nor felt able to correct it, nor even thought it necessary to do so.Then suddenly in the middle of this political discussion Anna Pavlovna launched forth in great excitement. Oh, dont talk to me about Austria3 Perhaps its all beyond me, but Austria has never wanted war and she still doesnt want war. Shes betraying us. Russia alone must be Europes saviour. Our benefactor is aware of his exalted calling and hell live up to it. Thats the one thing I do believe in. The noblest role on earth awaits our good and wonderful sovereign, and he is so full of decency and virtue that God will not forsake him. He will do what has to be done and scotch the hydra of revolution, which has become more dreadful than ever in the person of this murdering villain.4 We alone must avenge the blood of the righteous. And whom can we trust, I ask you England, with that commercial spirit of hers, cannot understand the lofty soul of our Emperor Alexander, and never will. She has refused to evacuate Malta.5 She keeps on looking for an ulterior motive behind our actions. What did they say to Novosiltsev Nothing. They didnt understand, theyre not capable of understanding, how altruistic our Emperor is  he wants nothing for himself but everything for the good of mankind. And what have they promised Nothing. And what little they have promised, they wont carry out. Prussia has already declared that Bonaparte is invincible and that the whole of Europe is powerless to oppose him . . . I for one dont believe a single word from Hardenberg or Haugwitz. That muchvaunted Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I put my faith in God and the noble calling of our beloved Emperor. Hell be the saviour of Europe She stopped suddenly, amused at her own passionate outburst. I think if they had sent you instead of our dear Wintzengerode,6 said the prince with a similar smile, an onslaught like that from you would have got the King of Prussia to agree. You are so eloquent. May I have some teaYes, of course. By the way, she added, calming down, there are two very interesting men coming here tonight  the Vicomte de Mortemart, a Montmorency through the Rohan line, one of the best French families. Hes the right kind of emigre, one of the genuine ones. And the Abbe Morio  such a profound thinker. Do you know him Hes been received by the Emperor. Have you heard Oh, it will be a pleasure to meet them, said the prince. But tell me, he added, with studied nonchalance, as if an idea had just occurred to him, though this question was the main reason for his visit, is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to become First Secretary in Vienna They do say hes a miserable creature, that baron. Prince Vasily wanted this post for his son, but other people were working through the Empress Maria Fyodorovna to get it for the baron. Anna Pavlovna halfclosed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else could pass judgement on what the Empress might feel like doing or want to do. Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister, was all she said, in a dry, lugubrious tone. As she pronounced the name of the Empress, Anna Pavlovnas face took on an expression of profound and sincere devotion mixed with respect and tinged with sadness, which invariably came upon her when she had occasion to mention her exalted patroness. She said that her Majesty had been gracious enough to show Baron Funke great respect, at which her face once again dissolved into sadness. The prince said nothing and showed no feeling. Anna Pavlovna, with all the sensitivity and quick thinking of both a courtier and a woman, decided to rebuke the prince for daring to refer in such a way to a person recommended to the Empress, and at the same time to console him. But, on the subject of your family, she said, do you realize how much your daughter has delighted everyone in society since she came out They say shes as beautiful as the day is long. I often think, Anna Pavlovna resumed after a short pause, edging closer to the prince and smiling sweetly to indicate that the political and social conversation was now at an end, and personal conversation was in order, I often think that good fortune in life is sometimes distributed most unfairly. Why has fate given you two such splendid children I dont include Anatole, your youngest  I dont like him, she commented in a peremptory tone and with raised eyebrows. Such charming children. And I must say you seem to appreciate them less than anyone. You really dont deserve them. What can I do Lavater would have said that I have no paternity bump,7 said the prince. Oh, do stop joking. I wanted a serious talk with you. Listen, Im not pleased with your younger son. Just between ourselves, her face went all gloomy again, his name has been mentioned in her Majestys presence, and people are feeling sorry for you . . . The prince said nothing, while she gave him a knowing look, waiting in silence for his reply. Prince Vasily frowned. What can I do he said at last. You know Ive done everything a father could do to bring them up well, and they have both turned out to be idiots. At least Hippolytes a fool on the quiet  Anatoles the rowdy one. Thats the only difference between them, he said, with an unusually awkward and forced smile, which gave a sharp twist to the lines round his mouth, making it surprisingly ugly and coarse. Why do men like you have children If you werent a father, I could find no fault with you, said Anna Pavlovna, looking up pensively. Im your faithful slave. I wouldnt admit it to anyone else, but my children are the bane of my life. Theyre the cross I have to bear. Thats how I explain it to myself. What would you . . .  He broke off with a gesture that signalled his resignation to a cruel fate. Anna Pavlovna thought things over. That prodigal son of yours, Anatole, havent you thought of marrying him off They do say, she went on, that old maids have a mania for matchmaking. So far Ive never been conscious of this failing in myself, but I do have a certain little person in my mind, someone who is very unhappy with her father  a relative of ours, the young Princess Bolkonsky. Prince Vasily made no reply, but being quick on the uptake and good at remembering things  qualities that came naturally to the denizens of high society  he gave a slight nod to show that he had noted her comment and was considering it. No, listen, do you realize that boys costing me forty thousand roubles a year he said, obviously unable to check the dismal drift of his thinking. He paused. What will it be like in five years time if he carries on like this You see what the benefits of fatherhood are . . . This princess of yours, is she rich Her fathers a very rich man and a miser. He lives out in the country. You know, Prince Bolkonsky. Hes very well known. He retired under the late Emperor. They used to call him the "the King of Prussia". Hes a very clever man, but hes a crank, not easy to get on with. Poor little thing, shes as miserable as any girl could be. It was her brother who married Liza Meinen not too long ago. Hes one of Kutuzovs adjutants. Hes coming here tonight. Listen, my dear Annette, said the prince, suddenly taking his companions hand and pressing it downwards for reasons best known to himself. You set this up for me, and Ill serve you like a faithful slave for ever. Or slafe, with an f, as my village elder puts it when he writes to me. Shes a girl from a good family, and shes rich. Thats all I need.And with the freedom, familiarity and sheer style that were his hallmark, he took hold of the maid of honours hand, kissed it and gave it a little shake, easing back into his armchair and looking away from her. Wait a minute, said Anna Pavlovna, thinking things over. Ill have a little talk with Lise, young Bolkonskys wife, this very evening. Perhaps something can be arranged. Ill use your family to start learning the old maids trade. Anna Pavlovnas drawingroom was steadily filling up. All the important people in St Petersburg society were there, varying enormously in age and character for all their shared social background. Prince Vasilys daughter, the beautiful Helene, had just arrived to take him on to the Ambassadors reception she was wearing a ballgown enhanced by a maid of honours monogram. The young Princess Bolkon sky, a slip of a girl known as the most seductive woman in Petersburg, was there too married the previous winter, she no longer appeared at large occasions because she was pregnant, but she did still attend small soirees. Prince Vasilys son, Prince Hippolyte, arrived with Mortemart, and introduced him. Also present were the Abbe Morio and many other people. Anna Pavlovna was welcoming her guests as they arrived with a Have you met my aunt or I dont think you know my aunt before steering them with great solemnity towards a little old lady with big bows in her hair, who had come sailing in from the next room as soon as the guests had begun to arrive. Anna Pavlovna would announce them by name, slowly transferring her gaze from guest to aunt, and then move on. All the guests went through the motions of greeting this aunt, who was unknown, uninteresting and unneeded by anyone. Anna Pavlovna observed their greetings with sadness and solemn sympathy, a picture of silent approval. The lady known as my aunt spoke in the same way to every new arrival, commenting on their health, her own health and the health of her Majesty, who was by now, thank God, feeling better. All those who approached were polite enough to refrain from showing undue haste, but once this onerous duty had been fulfilled they walked away from the old lady with a sense of relief, and never went near her again all evening. Young Princess Bolkonsky had brought some work with her in a goldembroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, slightly shadowed with down, barely covered her teeth, but that made it all the prettier when it rose up and lovelier still when it curled down to meet the lower lip. As tends to happen with the bestlooking women, a defect  in this case a short lip and a halfopen mouth  came out as a distinctive and beautiful feature. Everyone enjoyed the sight of this pretty little mothertobe, brimming with health and vitality and making light of her condition. After a few minutes in her company and the exchange of a word or two, old men and bored, morose young men felt as if they themselves were becoming like her. Anyone who talked to her, watching her as every word she spoke revealed that bright little smile and the constant gleam of those dazzling white teeth, walked away feeling full of bonhomie. Everybody did. The little princess waddled slightly as she tripped rapidly round the table, holding her tiny workbag, then she cheerfully smoothed down her dress and sat on a sofa near the silver samovar. Everything she did seemed like a treat for herself and everyone around her. Ive brought my work, she said in French, opening her reticule and addressing all the company. But listen, Annette, you must stop playing tricks on me, she said, turning to the hostess. You wrote and said it was only a little party. Just look what Ive got on. And she spread her arms wide to display an elegant grey dress, decorated with lace and set off by a broad sash just below the bosom. Dont worry, Lise, youll always be the prettiest, answered Anna Pavlovna. Did you know my husband is deserting me she said to a general, continuing to speak French and using just the same tone. Hes going off to get himself killed. Do tell me what this awful war is all about, she asked of Prince Vasily, but before he could answer she had moved on to his daughter, the beautiful Helene. Isnt she a gorgeous creature, this little princess said Prince Vasily to Anna Pavlovna. Shortly after the little princesss arrival, in walked a big, generously proportioned young man with closecropped hair and spectacles, wearing the last word in lightcoloured breeches and a tan coat with a jabot. This stout young man was the illegitimate son of a celebrated grandee from Catherines age, old Count Bezukhov, who was now on his deathbed in Moscow. He had not yet entered any branch of the service, having only just returned from abroad, where he had been completing his education. This was his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna welcomed him with the kind of bow she reserved for the lowest persons in the hierarchy of her drawingroom. But even as she bestowed her meanest welcome on this new arrival Anna Pavlovnas face was transformed she looked ill at ease and full of alarm, like someone who had come across some gross object, oversized and out of place. By a small margin Pierre was indeed the largest man in the room, but her look of dismay must surely have derived from this mans special look  intelligent, rather diffident, but also piercing and spontaneous  that made him a distinctive figure in the drawingroom. It is most kind of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come to see a poor sick woman, said Anna Pavlovna, looking anxiously across at her aunt as she steered him in her direction. Pierre mumbled something unintelligible, and continued to stare around the room, looking for something. He beamed with pleasure, bowed to the little princess as if she was a close friend of his, and then went over to the aunt. Anna Pavlovnas worst fears were confirmed when Pierre walked off without hearing the full story of her Majestys health. Rattled, Anna Pavlovna detained him with a question. You dont know the Abbe Morio, do you Such an interesting man . . .Yes, Ive heard about him and his scheme for everlasting peace. All very interesting, but not really feasible. Dont you think so asked Anna Pavlovna for the sake of saying something before getting back to her duties as hostess, but Pierre now committed the opposite kind of faux pas. Fresh from walking away without listening properly to a lady who was speaking to him, he now talked on and detained a lady who needed to get away from him. With his head lowered and his great legs thrust wide apart, he set about explaining to Anna Pavlovna why he thought the abbes scheme was a silly fancy. Could we talk about this later on smiled Anna Pavlovna.Detaching herself from this young man who had no idea how to conduct himself, she resumed her duties as hostess, watching and listening carefully, ready to render assistance at any point where the conversation was beginning to flag. Just as the foreman of a spinningmill settles the workers down and then strolls about the place on the lookout for a breakdown or any funny noise from a spindle, the slightest squeak or knock that would bring him rushing over to ease the machinery or make an adjustment, so Anna Pavlovna patrolled her drawingroom, walking over to any group where the talk was too little or too loud, and easing the machinery of conversation back into its proper, steady hum with a single word here or a tiny manoeuvre there. But busy as she was with all these preoccupations, she was still clearly worried about Pierre. She watched him anxiously as he went over to hear what was being said in Mortemarts circle, and then set off for a different group where the abbe was holding forth. Pierre had been educated abroad, and this evening party at Anna Pavlovnas was his first such occasion in Russia. Knowing that all the intelligentsia of Petersburg was gathered here, he was like a child in a toyshop, his eyes darting about everywhere. He was afraid of missing any intellectual talk that might have been his to hear. As he gazed at the assembled company, their faces pictures of refinement and selfconfidence, he was expecting to hear something very clever at any moment. Eventually he came over to Morio. The conversation struck him as interesting, so he stood there waiting for a chance to launch forth with his own ideas, as young people are wont to do.CHAPTER 3 Anna Pavlovnas soiree was now in full swing. On all sides the spindles were humming away nonstop. Apart from the aunt, and her sole companion, an elderly lady with a thin, careworn face, who seemed rather out of place in this brilliant society, the company had split into three groups. The one with most men in it centred around the abbe another group, of younger people, was dominated by the beautiful Princess Helene, Prince Vasilys daughter, and the pretty little Princess Bolkonsky, with her blushing features and a figure too full for her young age. Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna formed part of the third group. The viscount was a pleasantlooking young man with gentle features and manners, obviously full of his own importance, but modest enough, because of his good breeding, to indulge any company that he might find himself in. Anna Pavlovna was clearly showing him off to her guests. Just as a skilful head waiter can pass off as a supreme delicacy a cut of beef that would be inedible if youd seen it in the filthy kitchen, Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests that evening first the viscount and then the abbe as if they were supreme delicacies. In Mortemarts group the conversation had turned to the execution of the Duke of Enghien.8 The viscount held that the duke had perished through his own magnanimity, and there were special reasons behind Bonapartes animosity towards him. Oh, I say Do tell us all about it, Viscount, said Anna Pavlovna, delighted to feel she had insinuated a touch of Louis XV9 in the oldfashioned French phrase she had used. The viscount gave a polite bow and a willing smile. Anna Pavlovna brought them into a circle around him and beckoned everyone over to hear his story. The viscount was a personal friend of the duke, she whispered to one of them, and murmured to someone else, The viscount is such a good raconteur. To a third person she said, You see  what a man of quality, and the viscount was presented in the most refined and advantageous light, served up like a joint of beef garnished with salad on a hot platter. The viscount was preparing to launch forth his smile was subtle. My dear Helene, do come over here, said Anna Pavlovna to the gorgeous princess sitting in the very centre of the other group a little way off. Princess Helene rose with a smile, the same unchanging beautiful womans smile with which she had entered the room. With a gentle rustle of her white ballgown trimmed with ivy and moss, with her glistening white shoulders, glossy hair and sparkling diamonds, she moved between the men as they stepped aside to make way for her. Without looking anyone in the face, but beaming at the company in general and apparently bestowing permission for everyone to admire her wonderful figure, her full shoulders and her fashionably exposed bosom and back, she glided up to Anna Pavlovna, and the brilliance of the ballroom seemed to come with her. Helene was so exquisite that she not only avoided the slightest hint of flirtatiousness, she even seemed to be embarrassed by the alltooevident, truly devastating beauty that was hers. It was as if she wanted to tone down the effect of her beauty, but couldnt do so.What a beautiful woman said everyone who saw her. The viscount shrugged and looked down, as if transfixed by a mysterious force, as she arranged herself to sit before him, not sparing him that everdazzling smile.The princess rested her round, bare arm on a little table and found it unnecessary to say anything. She smiled, and she waited. Sitting up straight throughout the viscounts story, she glanced down occasionally either at her beautiful, round arm so casually draped across the table, or at her still lovelier bosom and the diamond necklace above it that kept needing adjustment. Several times she also adjusted the folds of her gown, and whenever the narrative made a strong impact on the audience she would glance across at Anna Pavlovna in order to imitate whatever expression she could see written on the maid of honours face before resuming her radiant smile. The little Princess Bolkonsky had also moved away from the tea table, following Helene. Wait a minute, I must have my work, she said. Come along, what are you thinking about she demanded of Prince Hippolyte. Please fetch my bag.With a smile and a word for everyone, the little princess got the whole group to rearrange itself, and then sat down and settled her skirts. Now Im all right, she insisted, and took up her work, inviting the viscount to begin. Prince Hippolyte brought her little bag, walked round behind her, moved up a chair and sat down beside her.The charming Hippolyte bore a close resemblance to his beautiful sister it was even more remarkable that in spite of the similarity he was a very ugly man. His features were like his sisters, but whereas she glowed with joie de vivre, classical beauty and the smiling selfassurance of youth, her brothers face was just the opposite  dim with imbecility, truculent and peevish  and his body was thin and feeble. His eyes, nose and mouth  all his features seemed to twist themselves into in a vague kind of obtuse snarl, while his arms and legs were always in an awkward tangle. Its not a ghost story, is it he asked, settling down next to the princess and jerking his lorgnette up to his eyes, as if he needed this instrument before he could say anything. Why no, my dear fellow, said the astonished viscount with a shrug. Its just that I cant abide ghost stories, said Prince Hippolyte, his tone implying that he had blurted all this out before realizing what it meant. Because of the selfconfidence with which he had spoken, no one could tell whether what he had said was very clever or very stupid. He was dressed in a dark green frockcoat, stockings, light shoes and kneebreeches of a colour he referred to as the thigh of a startled nymph. The viscount then gave a nice rendition of a story that was doing the rounds. Apparently the Duke of Enghien had driven to Paris for a secret assignation with a young woman, Mlle George, only to run into Bonaparte, who was also enjoying the favours of the same famous actress. On meeting the duke, Napoleon had fallen into one of his fainting fits and had been completely at the dukes mercy. The duke had not taken advantage of this, but Bonaparte had later rewarded his magnanimity by having him put to death. This was a very charming and interesting story, especially the bit when the rivals suddenly recognized each other, and it seemed to excite the ladies. Delightful said Anna Pavlovna, with an inquiring glance at the little princess. Delightful whispered the little princess, stabbing her needle into her sewing to show that the interest and charm of the story were getting in the way of her work. With a grateful smile of appreciation at this silent tribute, the viscount resumed his narrative, but Anna Pavlovna, who never took her eyes off the dreadful young man who was worrying her so much, could hear him holding forth with the abbe too forcefully and too heatedly, so she sped across into the danger zone on a rescue mission. Sure enough, Pierre had managed to get into a political conversation with the abbe about the balance of power, and the abbe, evidently taken by young mans naive passion, was expounding to him his cherished idea. Both men were listening too earnestly and talking too bluntly, and Anna Pavlovna didnt like it. You do it by means of the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people, the abbe was saying. If one powerful state like Russia  despite its reputation for barbarity  were to take a disinterested stand as the head of an alliance aimed at guaranteeing the balance of power in Europe, it would save the world But how are you going to get such a balance of power Pierre was gathering himself to say, but at that moment Anna Pavlovna came across, glowered at Pierre and asked the Italian how he was surviving the local climate. His face changed instantly and assumed the sickly sweet, patronizing air which he obviously reserved for conversations with women. I am so enchanted by the delightful wit and culture of the society people  especially the ladies  by whom I have had the good fortune to be received, that I have not yet had time to think about the climate, he said. Determined not to let go of the abbe and Pierre, Anna Pavlovna steered them into the larger group, where it would be easier to keep an eye on them. At this point in walked another guest, the young Prince Andrey Bolkonsky, husband of the little princess. He was quite short, but a very handsome young man, with sharp, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his languid, bored expression to his slow and steady stride, stood in stark contrast to his vivacious little wife. He made it obvious that he knew everybody in the room, and was so fed up with the whole lot that just looking at them and listening to them drove him to distraction. And of all the wearisome faces it was the face of his own pretty wife that seemed to bore him most. With a snarl distorting his handsome face he turned away from her. He kissed Anna Pavlovnas hand, screwed up his eyes and scanned the whole company.'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]].

In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]].

August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].== The Month ==[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735&amp;nbsp;BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&amp;nbsp;BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450&amp;nbsp;BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]].August does not begin on the same day of the week as any other month in [[common year]]s, but begins on the same day of the week as [[February]] in [[leap year]]s. August ends on the same day of the week as [[November]] every year, as each other's last days are 13 weeks (91 days) apart.In common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] of the previous year, and in leap years, [[June]] of the previous year. In common years, August finishes on the same day of the week as March and June of the previous year, and in leap years, [[September]] of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, August starts on the same day of the week as February of the previous year.In years immediately before common years, August starts on the same day of the week as [[May]] of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, [[October]] of the following year.

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the number of people who can relate to it, and how much they appreciate it. Some people also get inspired.The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.Art may express [[emotion]].  Artists may feel a certain emotion and wish to express it by creating something that means something to them.  Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an [[audience]].  However, if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work may become publicly successful.== History of art ==There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the [[Upper Palaeolithic|Upper Paleolithic]] era.All of the great ancient civilizations, such as [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Ancient India|India]], [[Ancient China|China]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Persia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[Painting|paintings]], [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronze, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada|Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geometry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle.'''Air''' refers to the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air is a [[mixture]] of many gases and tiny dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]], because it is [[matter]]. The weight of air creates [[atmosphere pressure|atmospheric  pressure]]. There is no air in [[outer space]]. Air is a [[mixture]] of about 78% of [[nitrogen]], 21% of [[oxygen]], 0.9% of [[argon]], 0.04% of [[carbon dioxide]], and very small amounts of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013).

In [[breathing]], the [[lung]]s put oxygen into the [[blood]], and send back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off the oxygen that we breathe. Without it we die of [[asphyxia]].[[Wind]] is moving air. This causes [[weather]].Air can be [[air pollution|polluted]] by some gases (such as [[carbon monoxide]], hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides), [[smoke]], and ash. This [[air pollution]] causes various problems including [[smog]], [[acid rain]] and [[global warming]]. It can damage people's [[health]] and the environment.Since early times, air has been used to create technology. Ships moved with sails and windmills used the mechanical motion of air. Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]]. [[Pneumatics]] use [[air pressure]] to move things. Since the late 1900s, air power is also used to generate electricity.Air is invisible: it cannot be seen by the eye, though a shimmering in hot aircanbeseen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencefocus.com/planet-earth/why-is-air-invisible/&lt;/ref&gt;Air is one of the four classical elements in Greek theory. It was considered an intervening element, somewhere between fire and water, and the driving force for the birth of the cosmos.== Brief history ==Earth's atmosphere has changed much since its formation.=== Original atmosphere ===At first it was mainly a [[hydrogen]] atmosphere. It  has changed dramatically on several occasions—for example, the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] 2.4 [[billion]] years ago, greatly increased [[oxygen]] in the atmosphere from practically no oxygen to levels closer to present day. Humans have also contributed to significant changes in atmospheric composition through air pollution, especially since industrialisation, leading to rapid environmental change such as ozone depletion and global warming.=== Second atmosphere ===Outgassing from [[volcanism]], supplemented by gases produced during the [[Late Heavy Bombardment|late heavy bombardment]] of Earth by huge asteroids, produced the next atmosphere, consisting largely of [[nitrogen]] plus [[carbon dioxide]] and [[inert gas]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Zahnle K; Schaefer L; &amp; Fegley B. 2010.

He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954.''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;== Early life and family ==Alan Turing was born in Maida Vale, [[London]] on 23 June 1912. His father was part of a family of [[merchant]]s from Scotland. His mother, Ethel Sara, was the [[daughter]] of an [[engineer]].=== Education ===Turing went to St. Michael's, a school at 20 Charles Road, St Leonards-on-sea, when he was five years old.&quot;This is only a foretaste of what is to come, and only the shadow of what is going to be.” – Alan Turing.The Stoney family were once prominent landlords, here in North Tipperary. His mother Ethel Sara Stoney (1881–1976) was daughter of Edward Waller Stoney (Borrisokane, North Tipperary) and Sarah Crawford (Cartron Abbey, Co. Longford); Protestant Anglo-Irish gentry.Educated in Dublin at Alexandra School and College; on October 1st 1907 she married Julius Mathison Turing, latter son of Reverend John Robert Turing and Fanny Boyd, in Dublin. Born on June 23rd 1912, Alan Turing would go on to be regarded as one of the greatest figures of the twentieth century.
A brilliant mathematician and cryptographer Alan was to become the founder of modern-day computer science and artificial intelligence; designing a machine at Bletchley Park to break secret Enigma encrypted messages used by the Nazi German war machine to protect sensitive commercial,diplomatic and military communications during World War 2. Thus, Turing made the single biggest contribution to the Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany, possibly saving the lives of an estimated 2 million people, through his effort in shortening World War II.
In 2013, almost 60 years later, Turing received a posthumous Royal Pardon from Queen Elizabeth II. Today, the “Turing law” grants an automatic pardon to men who died before the law came into force, making it possible for living convicted gay men to seek pardons for offences now no longer on the statute book.Alas, Turing accidentally or otherwise lost his life in 1954, having been subjected by a British court to chemical castration, thus avoiding a custodial sentence. He is known to have ended his life at the age of 41 years, by eating an apple laced with cyanide
== Career ==Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He created the theoretical  [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]].Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called &quot;[[Intelligence|intelligent]]&quot;. A computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.

In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;During [[World War II]], Turing worked with others to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). He  worked for the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's codebreaking centre that produced [[Ultra]] intelligence.Using [[cryptanalysis]], he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he worked on other German codes.From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was &quot;the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006.

In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.== Private life ==Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]].

*her [[emotion|feelings]] (in the songs &quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot; and &quot;All I Really Want&quot;)*sadness (in the song &quot;Mary Jane&quot;)*[[anger]] (in the song &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;)*frustration (in the songs &quot;Not the Doctor&quot; and &quot;Wake Up&quot;)
===Selected songs===Morissette has written many songs. Some of her most famous songs are:*&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; - This song is to Morissette's ex-boyfriend, a man she once loved. In this song, Morissette is very angry. She wants her ex-boyfriend to know that he caused many problems after leaving her for another woman.*&quot;[[Ironic (song)|Ironic]]&quot; - This song is about life. It contains several stories about unlucky people. In one of the stories, a man is afraid of flying on [[airplane]]s. He finally flies in one, but the airplane crashes.*&quot;You Learn&quot; - In this song, Morissette says that bad things happen in life, but people learn from them. Anyone can make bad things into good things. She wants people to try new things in life.*&quot;Uninvited&quot; - In this song, Morissette is not happy because she is famous. She does not know whether she wants to continue to be famous or not.*&quot;Thank U&quot; - In this song, she thanks many things that have helped her. She thanks [[India]], a [[country]] she visited and almost died in. She also lists ways she can improve herself.*&quot;Hands Clean&quot; - In this song, a man does something bad, and tells Morissette not to tell anyone else the bad thing the man did. She hides the man's secret for many years.Agriculture started thousands of years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues &quot;from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'&quot;. Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. {{ISBN|0-297-84258-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and became [[settler]]s in what became [[cities]].Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. University College London Press. {{ISBN|1-56098-675-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.== Types of farming ===== Arable farming ===Arable farming means growing [[crops]]. This would include [[wheat]] or vegetables like [[brussels sprout]]s. Growing [[fruit]] means having [[orchard]]s devoted to fruit. They cannot be switched easily with growing  field crops. Therefore they are not classed as arable land in the statistics.Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, animal hides ([[skin]]s or [[fur]]s), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]] , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]]).Many people still live by [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm. They can only grow enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and it is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. [[Drought]] and other problems sometimes cause [[famine]]s. Where yields are low, [[deforestation]] can provide new land to grow more food. This provides more [[nutrition]] for the farmer's family, but can be bad for the country and the surrounding [[environment]] over many years.In some countries, farms are often fewer and larger. During the 20th century they have become more productive because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, so fewer people can farm more land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more.This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.
Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value. They also choose plants that can survive [[plant disease]] and [[drought]], and are easier to harvest. Centuries of [[artificial selection]] and breeding have changed crop plants. The crops produce better yield. [[Fertilizers]], chemical [[pest control]], and [[irrigation]] all help.Some plants are improved with  [[genetic engineering]]. One example is modifying the plant to resist herbicides.== Food ==It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. People say it is not always safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.* Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.* Intensive agriculture is mostly done in countries with more money. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers.* Organic farming is using only natural products such as compost and green manure.* Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.
[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. Common goals of policy include the quality, amount, and safety of food.== Problems in agriculture ==There are some serious problems that people face trying to grow food today.
== Arithmetic ==In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;, and the name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;. Another name for the total is the [[sum]].
=== Counting examples ===For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has three of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group====Adding====Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that::{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children, and now have five children.'''Vertical Addition'''The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).First, the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, with the 3 written below and the 1 ten carried to the tens column. Next, in the tens column, the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, with the 5 written below and the 1 hundred carried to the hundreds column. Finally, in the hundreds column, 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, with the 2 written below and the 1 thousand carried to the thousand column. The final answer is thus one thousand two hundred and fifty three.
[[General American]] English is the kind most spoken in [[mass media]]. It more vigorously pronounces the letter &quot;R&quot; than some other kinds do. &quot;R-dropping&quot; is frequent in certain places where &quot;r&quot; sound is not pronounced after a [[vowel]]. For [[example]] as in the words &quot;car&quot; and &quot;card&quot; sounding like &quot;cah&quot; and &quot;cahd&quot;. This occurs in the Boston area.
